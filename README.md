## What is Lemmy

Lemmy (tribute to the great band Mot√∂rhead) is a web file manager based on Ruby On Rails. His goals are :

- Being Tag based, it means by files won't be managed with an hierarchical filesystem but will be handle with tags, and only tags.
- It will be a "ready to print" system. Send your text to Lemmy, and with git and LaTeX, he will provide you a nice document, ready to print.
- Lemmy is a Rock lover, so he will be a web p2p jukebox.

## Featuring

- Rails 4
- Foundation
- Icecast
- LaTeX
- Ruby of course

## Environnement

The idea of Lemmy is to be plateform independant but our advice is Debian and browsers like firefox and chromium. It will NOT be designed for internet explorer or any product from Microsoft.
